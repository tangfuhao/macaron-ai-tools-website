# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 12, 2025**
## **1. Introduction**

Welcome to **Macaron AI Tools** (“we”, “our”, “the App”).
We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how your data is used.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the rights you have regarding your data.

Macaron AI Tools provides a variety of AI-powered mini tools to assist with everyday tasks. To deliver certain features, the App may require access to device permissions or user-provided input, but **we do not collect, store, or upload any personal data to our servers.**

---

## **2. Data We Do NOT Collect**

We **do NOT**:

* store any personal data on external servers
* upload files, images, audio, or text to our servers
* collect analytics, logs, identifiers, or device information
* share data with third parties for marketing or advertising
* use Google Play Services, Firebase, or similar SDKs

All user-generated content remains **on the device** or is sent **only to the third-party AI service selected for the tool’s functionality**, never to us.

---

## **3. Information You Provide**

To use certain AI tools, you may voluntarily provide:

* **Images or photos** (for image editing or AI features)
* **Audio or microphone input** (for AI voice tools)
* **Text** (for AI writing/summarization tools)
* **Location** (if the tool requires contextual results)
* **Files from device storage** (for processing within the tool)

### **Important:**

* These inputs are used **only for the specific function you choose**.
* They are **not stored**, **not retained**, and **not uploaded** to any Macaron AI Tools server (because we do not operate one).

---

## **4. Third-Party AI Services**

To provide AI functionality, your inputs may be sent to **trusted third-party AI providers** (e.g., language model or image model APIs).

### These providers receive only:

* the data required to complete the tool request
* no identifiers from us
* no user account information

### These providers *do not* receive:

* your email
* your device data
* analytical data
* background information

You should review the privacy policies of the third-party AI service used in the specific tool if necessary.

---

## **5. Device Permissions**

The App may request access to the following permissions **only when required**:

### **• Camera**

Used to capture photos if a tool needs image input.
Not used for continuous background access.

### **• Photos / Media / Files**

Used to choose images or files for AI processing.
We do not access your entire library—only the files you select.

### **• Microphone**

Used for tools such as voice input or transcription.

### **• Location**

Only used when required for a location-related AI tool.
We do not store or track location data.

### **• Local Storage (App Sandbox)**

Used only to temporarily store user files or generated content.

We never collect or upload permission-based data.

---

## **6. Account Information**

To use the App, you may register and log in with an **email address**.

We store only:

* your email address
* basic authentication information required for login

We do **not** collect:

* names
* phone numbers
* location history
* device identifiers

Authentication data is used solely for enabling account-based usage and does not interact with AI inputs.

---

## **7. No Advertising & No Data Sharing**

* We do **not** display ads.
* We do **not** share any data with advertising partners.
* We do **not** sell personal information.
* We do **not** share any data with third parties except the third-party AI provider selected for the tool’s functionality.

---

## **8. Data Retention**

We do **not** retain any of your content (images, text, audio, location, files).
All processing occurs:

* on your device, or
* through a third-party AI API only while executing your request

Once processing is complete, the data is discarded.

Your email account data (used for login) is retained until you request deletion.

---

## **9. Children’s Privacy**

Macaron AI Tools is **not intended for users under 12**, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from minors.

If you believe a minor has created an account or submitted data, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.

---

## **10. Security**

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your account information (email login).
Since we do not store user-generated content, the risks associated with stored personal data are significantly reduced.

---

## **11. Your Rights**

Depending on your region, you may have the right to:

* Access your account information
* Delete your account
* Request removal of all associated login data
* Opt out of optional permissions
